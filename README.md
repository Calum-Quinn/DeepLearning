# Deep Learning Project

The goal of this repository is to store all the various files needed for completing [This course](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/6532316-introduction-to-deep-learning-models) on deep learning.

I want to use this project as a way of getting to know a new theme in my computer science journey all while studying at the HEIG-vd for my bachelor's degree.

[Here](https://github.com/Disruptive-Engineering-Limited/introduction-to-deep-learning) is a link to the repository I get to look at in case of difficulty completing a step.
